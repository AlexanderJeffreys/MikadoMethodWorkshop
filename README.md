This is a codebase for practising refactoring using the Mikado Method, to be used as part of the Mikado Method workshop.

The goal of the refactoring is to create two separate projects, one for the Space simulation, one for the Bouncing Balls simulation. There should be no code that is specific to one simulation in the other's codebase, but common code should be shared.
